# 2020-ELE559-workshop-zeropdk

Workshop for 9 students in ELE559, offered in the Spring semester of 2019 at Princeton University.

## A few statistics from the students:

### Question 1

| OS                                    | Number |
|---------------------------------------|--------|
| Windows 10 (Pro, Enterprise, Student) | 5      |
| macOS Catalina                        | 1      |
| macOS (Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave)   | 1      |
| Linux (Debian-like, e.g. Ubuntu)      | 2      |

### Question 2

| Prior Background | Number |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Solid-state physics | 8 |
| Basic Cleanroom Knowledge (Semiconductor device fabrication) | 4 |
| 2D CAD software | 5 |
| GDS format for mask layout | 1 |
| Analytical Geometry (you know how to represent shapes and formulate geometrical problems with equations) | 4 |
| Git and version control (only check if you know how to use it with ease) | 1 |

### Question 3

| Python Skills |  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| I have it and I use it for my work. I know the difference between Python 2 and 3, and I am comfortable switching between Python versions in different environments. I don't use MATLAB anymore, and I am comfortable reading source code. | 33.33% |
| I have some experience with it, but only for simple scripts. I can use packages but never had to read any source code. I have used successfully in the past to accomplish something at work. I am planning to learn python for my work. | 33.33% |
| I have it installed in my computer but I don't work with it. I prefer using other software for my work, such as MATLAB. But I am comfortable creating scripts in these other software for my day to day work. I could learn python for this but won't do it otherwise. | 22.22% |
| I am okay with programming scripts but don't use python in particular. I would be comfortable learning more  if it is necessary. | 11.11% |
| I don't know any programming and don't use python or any other programming language. It is something I never needed to do but I need it for my work, so I have to learn at some point. | 0.00% |
| I don't know any programming language and I don't need it for my work, ever. I am very uncomfortable learning it. | 0.00% |

### Question 4

| Likelihood of doing chip layout for work (elec. or phot.) | Number |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Certain | 4 |
| Likely | 3 |
| Unlikely | 2 |

### Question 5 (General comments and requests)

- **I would be interested in learning how to create a device that can perform spectroscopy with ring lasers and if possible frequency comb generation.**
    + There is a silicon nitride foundry that we used recently, called LIGENTEC. It is run by someone called Tobias Kippenberg, who has published on frequency comb generation.
    + See https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-018-0144-1 . One of the authors, Camille Br√®s, was a prior grad student in Prof. Prucnal's lab, who now also works in EPFL. She personally vouched for the foundry's quality, but if you need to be at the cutting edge of this field, it is best to collaborate with the faculty directly.
- **I'd really like a good overview of everything in question 2 that we need for laying out photonic chips**
    + Your ability to produce good-quality layouts will be proportional to your knowledge in all these areas.
    + I will try to give an overview of these subjects as needed but after the workshop I can send some references for further reading.
